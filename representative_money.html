    <h1>Gold as Money</h1>
    <p>
        Regarding money of exchange, the use of 
        <a href="./images/goldcertificate.jpg" title="gold certificate">
        representative money </a>
        historically pre-dates the invention of coinage as well. 
        In the ancient empires of Egypt, Babylon, India and China, 
        the temples and palaces often had commodity warehouses which made use of clay tokens 
        and other materials which served as evidence of a claim upon a portion of the goods stored in the warehouses. 
        Because these tokens could be redeemed at the warehouse for the commodity they represented, 
        they were able to be traded in the markets as if they were the commodity or given to workers as payment.
